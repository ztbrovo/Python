# Python's design goals :
# 1. A simple and intuitive language and as powerful as the main competitor；
# 2. Open source so that anyone can contribute to it；
# 3. The code is as easy to understand as English；
# 4. Suitable for daily tasks of short-term development.
# design concepts : Elegant, clear and simple.
# Features : 
# 1. It is a fully object-oriented language；To solve a problem first consider who will do it.Functions, modules, numbers, strings,etc.
# 2. Have a powerful standard library；
# 3. A large number of third-party modules which involves CS, AI, ML, etc.


#####  01. First HelloPython Program #####
# The python source program is a text file in a special format; The file extension is usually .py
# step: create 01-HelloPython.py file and edit as follows and execute this file using command python 01-HelloPython.py　in terminal.
print("hello python")
print("hello world")
# The function of print is to output the content inside the "" to the screen.
# frequent bugs: Misspell → NameError; Write multiple print functions on one line →　SyntaxError →　attention: Each line of code is responsible for completing an action.
# Indentation error →　IndentationError →　Attention: Do not add spaces before each line of code.
# Python 2.x defaultly do not support Chinese which Python 3.x supports. command python3 01-HelloPython.py
# Ipython I- interaction
# Python's IDE -- Pycharm , Integrated Development Environment

# annotation   # or """
                  """
# How to use annotation? Comments are not as many as possible; For complex operations, comments should be written before the operation starts; 
                       Add comments at the end of the line for code that cannot be understood immediately; Don’t describe the code, but explain why it’s written like this.

# The program is used to process data. Variables are used to store data.


#####  Variables  #####
# Each variable must be assigned a value before use.(=)

Identifiers(variable names or function names) and keywords(used identifiers by python).
letters, numbers and _ and can not be started with numbers and repeated with keywords. Identifiers need to be case sensitive.
Variable naming: first_name is better than FirstName or firstName.
