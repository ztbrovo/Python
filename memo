#####  01. First HelloPython Program #####
# The python source program is a text file in a special format; The file extension is usually .py
# step: create 01-HelloPython.py file and edit as follows and execute this file using command python 01-HelloPython.py　in terminal.
print("hello python")
print("hello world")
# The function of print is to output the content inside the "" to the screen.
# frequent bugs: Misspell → NameError; Write multiple print functions on one line →　SyntaxError →　attention: Each line of code is responsible for completing an action.
# Indentation error →　IndentationError →　Attention: Do not add spaces before each line of code.
# Python 2.x defaultly do not support Chinese which Python 3.x supports. command python3 01-HelloPython.py
# Ipython I- interaction
